### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

##Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow

About cost:

    App Service is cheaper than VM

About scalability:

    VM is more scalable than App Service

About Availability:

    Both are resilient to failures

About workflow:

    Using App Service is easier to deploy and manage

    Using VM gives you more control over the development environment

##Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app and justify that choice

I would choose the App Service for the following reason:

-Using App Service is cheaper than VM.

-This app is not big or complex so it is more cost-effective to use App Service than VM.

-This app is not affected by the development environment (No need to config the development environment) so using App Service is easier and less work than VM.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

If this app needs to config the development environment or changes the programming language which is not supported in App Service then I would consider using VM.
