### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

##Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow

* Costs:

- App Service costs less than VM.

* Regarding scalability:

- VM scales better than App Service

* What's available:

- Both can bounce back from setbacks.

* Regarding workflow:

- It is simpler to deploy and administer with App Service.

- You have more control over the development environment when using VM.

##Select the best option (VM or App Service) for deploying the app and explain your decision.

* The following are the reasons why I would select the App Service:

- App Service is less expensive than VM.

- Because this program is not large or sophisticated, using App Service rather than VM is more cost-effective.

- Utilizing App Service is simpler and less work than using a virtual machine since this app is not impacted by the development environment (there is no need to configure the development environment).	

### Examine app updates that might affect your choice.

- I would think about employing VM if this project has to configure the development environment or alter the programming language, both of which are not supported by App Service.
